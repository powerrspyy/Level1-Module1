    # TODO 1) Create an empty list of turtles

    # TODO 2) Create a new turtle and set its shape to 'turtle

    # TODO 3) Set the turtle's speed to 3

    # TODO 4) Set the turtle's pen up

    # TODO 5) Use the turtle's goto() method to set its position on the left
    #  side of the screen

    # TODO 6) use a loop to repeat the previous instructions and create
    #  8 turtles lined up on the left side of the screen
    #  *HINT* click on the window to print the corresponding x, y location

    # TODO 7) Move each turtle forward a random distance between 1 and 20

    # TODO 8) Create a loop to keep moving each turtle until a turtle
    #  crosses the finish line
    #  *HINT* click on the window to print the corresponding x, y location

    # TODO 9) When a turtle crosses the finish line, stop the race and
    #  indicate which turtle won the race.

    # EXTRA: Create different colors for each turtle and code a special
    # dance for the winning turtle!
